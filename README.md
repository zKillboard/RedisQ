# RedisQ

A simple queue service using Redis as the backend. All you have to do is point your code to https://zkillredisq.stream/listen.php. Then parse the JSON that you receive and do anything you like with it.

If no killmail has come in for 10 seconds, you'll receive a null package, example:
{"package":null}

The server will remember your queueID for up to 3 hours, therefore, pauses in your code will not cause you to miss out on killmails.

##### Do I need Redis to use this service?

You don't need Redis to use this service, its only called RedisQ because the service itself is powered by Redis.

##### How do I identify myself?

RedisQ will use the parameter queueID to identify you. This field is required! Example:

    https://zkillredisq.stream/listen.php?queueID=Voltron9000

##### How can I wait less than 10 seconds if there isn't a new killmail?

By default, RedisQ will wait up to 10 seconds for a new killmail to come in. To wait less than this 10 seconds, you can use the ttw parameter, which is short for timeToWait. Example:

    https://zkillredisq.stream/listen.php?ttw=1

And yes, you can combine the ttw and queueID parameters. The code will enforce a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 seconds.

##### Something changed with the way RedisQ works, help?

As of August, 2025, a change has been implemented such that the /listen.php endpoint redirects to /object.php with an objectID for your next package.  Be sure that whatever tool you are using can accommodate redirects.

    https://zkillredisq.stream/object.php?objectID=NotRealObjectID

#### Limitations

- You may have one (1) request being handled at a time per queueID. Additional requests being served while another request is already polling will resolve with http code 429.
- You may request at a limit of two (2) requests per second per IP address.  This limitations is enforced by CloudFlare â€“ if you exceed this limitation your request will resolve with http code 429.

#### FAQ

###### So, this seems too easy. What do I have to do again?

It really is very, very simple. All you have to do is point something at https://zkillredisq.stream/listen.php, that can be curl, file_get_contents, wget, etc. etc. Here's an example of getting a killmail with PHP

  ```
  $raw = file_get_contents("https://zkillredisq.stream/listen.php?queueID=YourIdHere");
  $json = json_decode($raw, true);
  $killmail = $json['package'];
  ```
  
That's it, really. You now have a killmail. Put that into a loop and you can keep feeding yourself all the killmails as zKillboard gets them.

###### Can I have pauses between requests without missing any killmails?

Yes, RedisQ identifies you based on your queueID and will remember you for up to 3 hours. So you can setup cron jobs to run every minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, etc. and not worry about missing any of the killmails.

###### Can I use more than one connection on RedisQ?

(This sections is currently deprecated, perhaps only temporarily) 

Only one connection at a time is allowed. If you try for more the extra connections will receive a http 429 error. Too many 429 errors will cause your IP and userid (if provided) to be temporarily banned for several hours.

###### Can I subscribe to just my pilot's / character's / alliance's killmails?

Not at this time. I went with stupidly simple simplicity when I made this and didn't bother with any code for filters and/or subscriptions. You can easily write the code on your end to filter the killmails to your preferences.

###### Seriously? Why do this and not use websockets or something like that?

Websockets are great, sure, but I wanted to write something that was damn easy to implement in any language. RedisQ isn't trying to be fancy like websockets, it is only trying to disemminate killmails in a quick and very simple fashion.

###### Why is it called RedisQ?

Because I used Redis to implement what I was trying to do, it's a queue type service, and so I went with the completely unoriginal name RedisQ.

###### Why are you using .php extension when RedisQ isn't using PHP?

The initial version of RedisQ utilized PHP as the backend language of choice.  However, a subsequent rewrite is now using NodeJS.  To keep things simple and allow for great backwards compatibility the endpoints kept their .php extension.

###### I thought the URL was redisq.zkillboard.com?

The URL was changed in May, 2025 to zkillredisq.stream.

###### How do I say RedisQ?

Everyone says it different, but I say it like red-is-q.  You can say it however you want though.
